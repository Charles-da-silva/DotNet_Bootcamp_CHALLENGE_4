# DotNet_Bootcamp_CHALLENGE_4

Kogu is looking for the dragon balls to summon Xenlonguinho and ask him to revive his friend Kuriri, who unfortunately died in the last battle of the Zê warriors.

However, Kogu is having a hard time finding the spheres, so Xenlonguinho, who has been known to him for a long time, decided to make an exception and accepted to be invoked if Kogu finds all the spheres whose number of divisors of the amount of stars in the sphere is even.

For example if there are seven spheres, Kogu would not need to find the one and four star spheres, as they have an odd amount of dividers, so he only needs to get 5 spheres to summon Xenlonguinho.

Since Kogu is not very good at math, he asked you to write a program that, given the total number of spheres available, shows the minimum amount of spheres he needs to look for.

Input
The first line consists of an integer C that represents the number of test cases. The subsequent lines contain an integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000) that represents the amount of spheres needed to invoke Xenlonguinho.

Exit
Your program should display the minimum amount of spheres that Kogu has to look for.
